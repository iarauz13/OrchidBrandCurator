# User Interview Script: Orchid Brand Curator Validation

**Goal**: Validate that "fragmented brand tracking" is a painful enough problem to solve, and test willingness to pay for a premium solution.
**Target Audience**: "Brand Enthusiasts" – people who follow 10+ brands on social media, work in creative fields, or are frequent online shoppers.
**Duration**: ~15-20 Minutes

---

## 1. Introduction (2 Mins)
*   "Hi, thanks for chatting. I'm building a tool to help people organize the brands and products they discover online. I’m not selling anything today—I just want to learn from how you currently do things."
*   "There are no wrong answers, so please be honest even if it's negative."

## 2. Screening / Warm-up (3 Mins)
*   "To start, tell me about the last time you discovered a new brand or product you liked online. Where were you? (Instagram/TikTok/Pinterest?)"
*   "How often would you say you come across a new brand you want to remember? (Daily/Weekly?)"
    *   *Red Flag*: If they say "Rarely" or "I just buy immediately," they might not be our power user.

## 3. Extracting Current Behavior (The "Competitor" Check) (5 Mins)
*   **The Golden Question**: "When you saw that brand, what exactly did you do to save it?"
    *   *Did they screenshot it?*
    *   *Did they Save to Instagram Collection?*
    *   *Did they send it to a friend?*
    *   *Did they keep a browser tab open?*
*   "Can you open your phone right now and show me where that saved item is?" (Watch them struggle. Do they scroll endlessly through photos? Do they forget where it is?)
*   "What is annoying about doing it that way?"

## 4. Problem Validation (5 Mins)
*   "Have you ever tried to find a brand you saved months ago but couldn't? Tell me about that."
*   "Do you currently have a list of 'brands to try' or 'gift ideas'? Where does it live?"
*   "If you had to rate your current system of organizing brands from 1 (Chaos) to 10 (Perfection), what is it?"

## 5. Concept Testing (3 Mins)
*   *Pitch*: "Imagine an app that acts like a digital wallet for brands. You share a link from Safari or Instagram, and it automatically pulls the logo, category, and tags it. It feels like a premium deck of cards for your taste. You can create lists like 'Skincare to try' or 'Interior Design Inspo'."
*   "On a scale of 1-5, how useful would that be to you personally?"
*   "Why did you give it that rating?" (If 3 or lower, ask what's missing).

## 6. Willingness to Pay (Monetization Check) (2 Mins)
*   "The basic version is free. We are thinking of a 'Pro' version that includes custom app icons, home screen widgets (so you see daily inspo), and unlimited collections."
*   "Would you pay **$5/month** for that? Why or why not?"
    *   *Note*: Watch their face. Hesitation usually means "No."
*   "What is one feature that would make it a 'no-brainer' subscription for you?"

## 7. Wrap Up
*   "Is there anything else managing your digital shopping/inspiration that frustrates you?"
*   "Thanks for your time!"

## Success Criteria (Pass/Fail)
*   **PASS**:
    *   User admits their current system (Screenshots/Notes) is messy/stressful.
    *   User can recall a specific moment they lost a brand they wanted to find.
    *   At least 30% express interest in the $5 price point OR give a strong "I need this now" for the free version.
*   **FAIL**:
    *   User says "I just use Pinterest and it works fine."
    *   User says "I don't really save brands, I just buy what I need."
